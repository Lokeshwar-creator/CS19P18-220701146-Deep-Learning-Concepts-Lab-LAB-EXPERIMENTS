BUILD A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (RNN) USING
KERAS/TENSORFLOW

Aim: To build a recurrent neural network with Keras/TensorFlow.

Procedure: 
1. Download and load the dataset. '
2. Perform analysis and preprocessing of the dataset. 
3. Build a simple neural network model using Keras/TensorFlow. 
4. Compile and fit the model. 
5. Perform prediction with the test dataset. 
6. Calculate performance metrics.

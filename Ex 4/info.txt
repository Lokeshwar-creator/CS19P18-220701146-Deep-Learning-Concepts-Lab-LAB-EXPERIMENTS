TRANSFER LEARNING WITH CNN AND VISUALIZATION
Aim: To build a convolutional neural network with transfer learning and perform visualization

Procedure: 1. Download and load the dataset. 
2. Perform analysis and preprocessing of the dataset. 
3. Build a simple neural network model using Keras/TensorFlow. 
4. Compile and fit the model. 
5. Perform prediction with the test dataset. 
6. Calculate performance metrics.

EX NO: 1 CREATE A NEURAL NETWORK TO RECOGNIZE HANDWRITTEN
DIGITS USING MNIST DATASET

Aim: To build a handwritten digitâ€™s recognition with MNIST dataset.
Procedure: 1. Download and load the MNIST dataset. 
2. Perform analysis and preprocessing of the dataset. 
3. Build a simple neural network model using Keras/TensorFlow. 
4. Compile and fit the model. 
5. Perform prediction with the test dataset. 6. Calculate performance metrics.

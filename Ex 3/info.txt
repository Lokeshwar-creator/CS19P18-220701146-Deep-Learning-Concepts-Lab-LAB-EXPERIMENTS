EX NO: 3 IMAGE CLASSIFICATION ON CIFAR-10 DATASET USING CNN

Aim: To build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying images from the

CIFAR-10 dataset into one of the ten categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, etc. 
Procedure:
1.  Download and load the CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras/TensorFlow. 
2.  Visualize and analyze sample images from the dataset. 
3, Preprocess the data:
 Normalize the pixel values (divide by 255)
 Convert class labels to one-hot encoded format
4.  Build a CNN model using Keras/TensorFlow:
 Include convolutional, pooling, flatten, and dense layers.
5.  Compile the model with suitable loss function and optimizer. 
6.  Train the model using training data and validate using test data. 
7.  Evaluate the model using accuracy and loss on test dataset. 
8.  Perform predictions on new/unseen CIFAR-10 images. 
9.Visualize prediction results with sample images and predicted labels

BUILD A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK
USING KERAS/TENSORFLOW 

Aim: To implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras/TensorFlow to recognize and classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset with high accuracy. 

Procedure:
1. Import required libraries (TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, etc.).
2.Load the MNIST dataset from Keras. 
3.Normalize and reshape the image data.
4.Convert labels to one-hot encoded vectors. 
5.Build a CNN model with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, and Dense layers. 
6.Compile the model using categorical crossentropy and Adam optimizer. 
7.Train the model on training data. 
8.Evaluate the model on test data. 
9.Display accuracy and predictions.
